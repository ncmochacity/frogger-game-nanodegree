===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

##Overview
The Javascript Arcade Game aims to utilize Object-Oriented Programming logics paired with HTML5 Canvas. The purpose of this game is re-creating a simple version of the classic Frogger Game by using the provided visual assets and game loop. I added custom classes and functions to lay out the game design including the Player, Enemies, Rewards and Life to make it more playful. 

##Getting Started
**Local environment**

1. Clone this repository

`git clone git@github.com:ncmochacity/frogger-game-nanodegree.git `

2. Play the game inside your browser by opening the index.html
